<p>In order to include a book I would need an index of the page headers. I have set up a page where you can input page headers easily, it has already been used successfully by several volunteers for completing the index of the Steingass book. Contact me at ejtaal@gmail.com for more details.</p>

<h1>What is the Arabic Almanac?</h1>
<p>It is a HTML/JavaScript app for both desktop and mobile use that allows looking up Arabic roots in Hans Wehr and Lane's Lexicon simultaniously. Other books are in the process of being prepared for inclusion.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may download the entire contents
to your hard disk or smart phone's sd card, for fast offline usage. Read below for more information on downloading and installing it.</p>
<h1>Books currently included</h1>
<h2>HW: Hans Wehr</h2>
<p>Started around WW2 and amended a few times since then, it is a very concise dictionary listing some commonly found sayings. Its drawback is that is focuses more on the language as it is found in print today with all sorts of modern usages, making it difficult to find meanings intended in older texts.</p>
<h2>LL/LS: Lane's Lexicon + supplement</h2>
<p>This is a monumental work written in the 19th century, where the author has gone through dozens of arabic sources and compiled a lot of relevant examples for each root, from Quran, Hadeeth, poetry and proverbs. It is extremely verbose which sometimes makes it difficult to find what the word you're looking for. The main work only goes uptil the letter qaf, and the supplement written after the author's death relies on his notes and is therefore unfortunately lacking. Still extremely useful nonetheless. In this website the supplement will close and open automatically for you depending on whether you search for a root before or after the letter qaf respectively.</p>
<h2>SG: Steingass</h2>
<p>This dictionary seems to fill the gap between Hans Wehr and Lane's Lexicon in that it was also written in the 19th century and also focuses on classical meanings. See for example the translation of 'to plough' under IV of the root thwr (tha wow ra) which is not in Wehr but is present in the lexicon. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Joseph_Steingass">Biography of the author</a></p>
<h2>Hava</h2>
<p>A very basic dictionary focusing on some more classical meanings.</p>
<h1>How to use</h1>
<p>Click on the search button and enter the arabic root you would like to look up. You may use roman (english) letters incase you don't have an arabic keyboard. The letters will be replaced according to the following table:</p>
<pre>
Double letters:
th -> "ث"       gh -> "غ"
kh -> "خ"       sh -> "ش"
dh -> "ذ"

Different cases:
d -> "د"        t -> "ت"
D -> "ض"        T -> "ط"
z -> "ز"        h -> "ه"
Z -> "ظ"        H -> "ح"
s -> "س"
S -> "ص"

All other "normal" letters:
a -> "ا"        q -> "ق"   
b -> "ب"        k -> "ك"
j -> "ج"        l -> "ل"
7 -> "ح"        m -> "م"
r -> "ر"        n -> "ن"
E, e or 3 -> "ع"   w -> "و"
f -> "ف"        y -> "ي"
v -> "ث"
</pre>

<p>There are also some keyboard shortcuts you can use:</p>
<pre>
search (find): f
switch between column and full page view: v
make pages fit to window: w

The following keys only apply for the book you're currently looking at:
back 1 page: left arrow, d or z
forward 1 page: right arrow, g or x
</pre>

<h1>Browser support</h1>
<p>This table aims to show which browsers support the current version of
Arabic Almanac:</p>
<pre>
|Browser                 |Website works? |Comments
+------------------------+---------------+-----------
|Opera (Desktop)         |Yes            |Main browser for testing|
|Opera Mobile            |Yes            |Should work on any smart phone/tablet on which Opera Mobile can run|
|Opera Mini              |No             |This site relies heavily on JavaScript, which Opera Mini doesn't support very well. Some things may work, |but most of it won't.|
|Google Chrome           |Yes            |Seems to work ok.|
|Firefox (desktop)       |Yes            |Seems to work ok.|

|Android default browser |Yes            |Seems to work ok now.|
|Internet Explorer 7/8/9 |Yes            |Seems to work ok now.|
+------------------------+---------------+--------------
</pre>

<h2>Should work on most smart phones &amp; tablets!</h2>
<p>Depending on your screen resolution it will decide upon
first load to either use full width view or single column view mode,
so that it should select full view when you use this page on a largish
desktop/tablet screen but column mode if you access it using your smart
phone. You can always change the view manually with the 'View' button.
<p>Warning! With all books visible a single page may take up to 500k of
data! Watch your internet usage allowance!</p>
<h1>Download for offline use</h1>
<p>You can now download the entire website and install it for instance on your phone's SD card
or your desktop PC for super fast access.<br>
Download link: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main download site @ archive.org:</strong> <a href="http://ia700803.us.archive.org/2/items/ArabicAlmanac/Arabic_Almanac_v2.0.zip">Arabic_Almanac_v2.0.zip</a></li>
<li><small>Secondary backup site: <a href="../Arabic_Almanac_v2.0.zip">here</a></small></li>
</ul>
<p>The size is about 687 MB. The zip file contains a folder named "aa" which you should place somewhere on your
PC's drive or on your phone's SD card. For desktops you should then be able to do "File-&gt;Open" and select
the index.html file within the "aa" folder. On smart phones &amp; tablets I recommend
using the free Opera browser (the full one, not the Mini) to go the following url:
<a href="file://localhost/sdcard">file://localhost/sdcard</a>, then locate the "aa" folder and click on index.html, and hopefully it should
work :)</p>
<h1>TODO</h1>
<ul>
<li>Add more dictionaries...</li>
<li>Improve roman -&gt; arabic letters substitution (make it more like yamli)</li>
</ul>
