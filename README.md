I could really use your help with the following:
- Updating the index of Hans Wehr (3rd print); Currently this website uses the 3rd print and you may have experience the index of the pages for Hans Wehr is sometimes a off by a page when looking up a certain root. This is due to the fact that the index uses the page headers which have been assigned in a non-conventional way, namely listing the first root for pages on the left hand side and listing the last root on the page for pages on the right.
- Adding 3 new dictionaries; I have been asked to add Kazimirski (a popular Arabic -> French dictionary) to the Almanac which seems like a great idea. I'd also like to add the popular Misbah ul Lughat for the benefit of Urdu speakers. On top of that I've been pointed to the 4th print of Hans Wehr being available as a pdf so I would like to include this as well, but can only do so with help in preparing the index.

How could you help with these indexes?
======================================

I would need a list of the last root used on every page of the book. You could provide in any way you wish, a spreadsheet probably being the easiest. If a number of people can contribute we can share the workload.

Contact me at ejtaal@gmail.com if you could help with any of the above.
