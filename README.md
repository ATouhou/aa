I could really use your help with the following:
- Updating the index of Hans Wehr; As you may have experience the index of the pages for Hans Wehr is sometimes a off by a page when looking up a certain root. This is due to the fact that the index uses the page headers which have been assigned in a non-conventional way, namely listing the first root for pages on the left hand side and listing the last root on the page for pages on the right.
- Adding new dictionaries; I have been asked to add a popular AR -> French dictionary to the Almanac which seems like a great idea. The only help I would need is to be provided with a spreadsheet listing the page headers for each page. I can then prepare the scanned images from the dictionary itself for inclusion. I would like to add Misbah ul Lughat as I'm told this is very popular with Urdu speakers.

Contact me at ejtaal@gmail.com if you could help with any of the above.

How to use
==========
Click on the search button and enter the arabic root you would like to look up. You may use roman (english) letters incase you don't have an arabic keyboard. The letters will be replaced according to the following table:

TODO
====

- Improve roman -> arabic letters substitution (make it more like yamli)
